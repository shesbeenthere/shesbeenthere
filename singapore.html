    <h1>History </h1>
    <p class="history">Early Singapore: A Brief History </p>
    <p class="history">Much of Singapore&rsquo;s history has been lost with time. Little to no information about this island is known before the late 13th century. Some of the earliest recorded settlements date back to 1298 AD in the city known as Temasek or &ldquo;Sea Town.&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="history">Legend has it that the Prince of Indonesia was on a hunting excursion when he caught site of an unfamiliar animal.  Taking this as a sign of good luck, he went back to the place where he spotted this animal and founded a city. He named this city Singapura which translates into &ldquo;<a href="http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Singapore-history.htm" class="link">The Lion City.</a>&rdquo; </p>
    <p class="history">In the years following, Singapura was ruled by five ancient kings who transformed the city into a meeting point of sea roots and a flourishing trading post for surrounding countries. <br>
      In the late 18th century, the British began to take control of this region. They saw a perfect opportunity to establish their own trading post, as well as protect their merchant fleet from any threats by neighboring countries. A new empire was born and the country began to prosper.</p>
    <p class="history">As the early 19th century began, Britain offered a series of <a href="http://www.singaporeexpats.com/about-singapore/brief-history.htm" class="link">proposals</a> that granted Singapore greater measure of self-government. On August 9th, 1965, Singapore became a sovereign, democratic and independent nation. </p>
    <p class="history">Modern Singapore: <a href="http://www.yoursingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore.html?&http://www.yoursingapore.com/travel-guide-tips/about-singapore.html?&cmp=Leisure_US_googleSEM_(US)-SG_History+Generic_Singapore+Independence_+singapore%20independence%20+history&mkwid=sV9cFKNLb_pcrid_117015072906_pdv_c&gclid=CNy66tu2z9ACFUokgQodX2cMTw&mkwid=sV9cFKNLb_117015072906_%252Bsingapore%20independence%20%252Bhistory_b_c&mtid=9857im24642&slid=&product_id" class="link">Independence</a></p>
    <p class="history">In 1953, Britain began to nudge Singapore in the direction of self-government and independence. Two short years later in 1955,  the first election was held and a new government was formed. The countries newest challenge was learning how to be sovereign. Under the leadership of <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/lee-kuan-yew-9377339#indonesia-independence" class="link">Lee Kuan Yew </a>and the PAP (<a href="https://www.pap.org.sg" class="link">People&rsquo;s Action Party</a>), the nation began to flourish. Trade between Japan and the United States increased and Singapore became a major shipping port.</p>
    <p class="history">In 1967, Singapore joined ASEAN (<a href="http://asean.org" class="link">Association of Southeast Asian Nations</a>) to help continue to promote regional stability, economic development, and cultural exchange. </p>
    <p class="history"><br>
      By the early 1970&rsquo;s Singapore had become a world leader in shipping, air transport and oil refining.<br>
      On August 9th, 1965, Singapore separated itself from Malaysia and started on the road towards independence. <br>
      Present day Singapore continues to flourish both economically and culturally. They are among the most successful countries in Southeast Asia and continue to lead in the transportation and distribution of freight and cargo around the world.  </p>

    <h1>Food</h1>
    <p class="history"><u>Traditional Cuisine:</u><br>
      Singaporean cuisine contains influence from many Southeast Asian countries. Heavily influenced by China and Indonesia, Singaporean food also contains Indian, Western, Sri Lankan, Thai and Middle Eastern influences. Most restaurants around Singapore are quite pricey compared to the United States and the countries surrounding Singapore. Because of this, many locals and tourists are drawn to the unique Singaporean hawker markets that are scattered around the city. </p>
    <p class="history"><br>
        <u>What is a hawker?</u><br>
      Hawker centers are giant open-air food courts with dozens of stalls selling fresh, local cuisine. Each stall offers its own specialty dish. Many hawker markets are outdoors and contain a variety of dishes from various cultures. </p>
    <p class="history"><br>
        <u><a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d878152-Reviews-Long_Beach_MAIN_Seafood_Restaurant-Singapore.html"><img src="images/chilicrab.jpg" alt="Singaporean Chili Crab" width="200" height="150" class="leftpic"/></a>Local Food: </u><br>
      There are many local dishes that are native to Singapore. Like most Asian Countries, meats and fish served with rice are often common meals consumed in Singapore. Chicken rice, offered at most hawker centers, is made up of sticky white rice, poached chicken and a traditional sauce — usually comprised of garlic, ginger and pandan leaves.</p>
    <p class="history">Chili crab and black pepper crab are two other famous Singaporean dishes. <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g294265-d878152-Reviews-Long_Beach_MAIN_Seafood_Restaurant-Singapore.html" class="link">Long Beach Restaurant</a> in Singapore&rsquo;s East Coast Park, is famous for its fresh Chili crab and tasty black pepper crab </p>
